# 🍷 Wine Type Classification using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and basic predictive modeling on two wine quality datasets: one for red wine and another for white wine.

## 📁 Files

- `wine-quality-notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full analysis, visualizations, and machine learning models.
- `winequality-red.csv`: Dataset containing physicochemical attributes and quality ratings of red wines.
- `winequality-white.csv`: Dataset containing physicochemical attributes and quality ratings of white wines.

## 📊 Dataset Description

These datasets contain information on various chemical properties of wines (e.g., acidity, sugar content, pH) along with a quality score rated by wine tasters.

**Common Features Include:**
- Fixed acidity  
- Volatile acidity  
- Citric acid  
- Residual sugar  
- Chlorides  
- Free sulfur dioxide  
- Total sulfur dioxide  
- Density  
- pH  
- Sulphates  
- Alcohol  
- Quality (score between 0 and 10)

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Perform data cleaning and preparation  
- Visualize key relationships between features  
- Compare red and white wine characteristics  
- Build classification models to predict wine quality  
- Evaluate model performance and interpret results  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.  
2. Open `wine-quality-notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.  
3. Ensure the CSV files are in the same directory as the notebook.  
4. Run the cells step by step to follow the analysis.  

## 📈 Example Visualizations

- Distribution of wine quality ratings  
- Correlation heatmaps of wine features  

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  

Models are evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
